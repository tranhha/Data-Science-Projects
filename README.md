# My Data Science Projects
Data Science/Machine Learning Projects with Python. All projects are written in Python. These projects mainly feature techniques used in Data Science such as: data pipelining, data preprocessing, data visualization etc as well as some common models and practices in Machine Learning. Most projects are for educational purpose. I really appreciate any feedback as I'm working toward to be a better data scienctist.

Here are summary of some of the projects:

- **Build Spam Filters with Naive Bayes Algorithm**: A step-by-step implementation of Naive Bayes Algo with some mathematical exaplanation to build a SMS spam filter.

- **Heart Failure Predict**: A Kaggle challenge. Build and compare different machine learning models to predict the odds of one person having a heart disease given their health attributes.

- **Predicting Bike Rentals**: A project from [DataQuest](https://www.dataquest.io/). Build ML model to predict hourly bike rentals in Washington DC.

- **Predicting House Sales Price**: Using LinearRegression to predict house sale prices in Ames, Iowa from 2006-2010
