# My Data Science Projects
Data Science/Machine Learning Projects with Python. All projects are written in Python. These projects mainly feature techniques used in Data Science such as: data pipelining, data preprocessing, data visualization etc as well as some common models and practices in Machine Learning. Most projects are for educational purpose. I really appreciate any feedback as I'm working toward to be a better data scienctist.

Here are summary of some of the projects:

- [**Build Spam Filters with Naive Bayes Algorithm**](https://github.com/tranhha/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Build%20spam%20filters%20with%20Naive%20Bayes%20Algorithm): A step-by-step implementation of Naive Bayes Algo (more specifically, Multinomial Naive Bayes) with some simplified mathematical explanation to build a SMS spam filter. Compare the result of the implementation-from-scratch of the algorithm with the built-in package from [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB.html).

- [**Heart Failure Prediction**](https://github.com/tranhha/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Heart%20Failure%20Prediction): A Kaggle challenge. Build and compare different machine learning models (including kNN, logistic, SVC, RandomForest and GradientBoost) to predict the odds of one person having a heart disease given their health attributes. 

- [**Predicting Bike Rentals**](https://github.com/tranhha/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Predicting%20Bike%20Rentals%20-%20RandomForest): A project from [DataQuest](https://www.dataquest.io/). Build a RandomForest model to predict hourly bike rentals in Washington DC from 01-01-2011 to 12-31-2012. 

- [**Predicting House Sales Price**](https://github.com/tranhha/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Predicting%20House%20Sale%20Prices%20(Linear%20Regression)): This project introduce basics steps of **feature engineering** and **feature selection** in a typical ML project. Using LinearRegression to predict house sale prices in Ames, Iowa from 2006-2010
